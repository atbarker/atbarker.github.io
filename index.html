	<p>
	  I am a fifth year Computer Science Ph.D candidate under Darrell Long and 
          work in the Storage Systems Research Center at UC Santa Cruz. My research 
          is primarily in the development of a deniable steganographic storage 
          system (<a href="https://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/proj/Artifice.html">Artifice</a>) 
          but also branches into secure file systems and network based covert 
	  timing channels (Vinz Clortho) and secure deletion (<a href="https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/proj/securefs.html">Lethe</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of research I also enjoy vintage computing, fishing, backpacking, 
          and getting caught up in niche hobbies and DIY projects.

                <h4>Artifice</h4>
                <p>The challenge of deniability for sensitive data can be a life 
                   or death issue depending on location. Plausible deniability 
                   directly impacts groups such as democracy advocates relaying 
                   information in repressive regimes, journalists covering human 
                   rights stories in a war zone, and NGO workers hiding food 
                   shipment schedules from violent militias. All of whom would 
                   benefit from a plausibly deniable storage system. Previous 
                   deniable storage solutions only offer pieces of an 
                   implementable solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Artifice operates through the use of a virtual block device 
                   driver stored separately from the hidden data. It uses external 
                   entropy sources and erasure codes to deniably and reliably 
                   store data within the unallocated space of an existing file 
                   system. A set of data blocks to be hidden are combined with 
                   entropy blocks through error correcting codes to produce a set 
                   of obfuscated carrier blocks that are indistinguishable from 
                   other pseudorandom blocks on the disk. A subset of these blocks 
                   may then be used to reconstruct the data. Artifice presents a 
                   truly deniable storage solution through its use of external 
                   entropy and error correcting codes, while providing better 
                   reliability than other deniable storage systems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Artifice is implemented as a Linux Device Mapper target and is 
                   distributed as a loadable Linux kernel module. It is intended 
                   to be installed on a bootable Live disk and be used alongside a 
                   distribution such as Tails. It will support NTFS, EXT4, and FAT32 
                   as public file systems. Artifice source code will be released 
		   under GPL upon completion.<br>

                <h4>Vinz Clortho</h4>
                <p>
                   Covert timing channels present a means of securely transferring 
                   sensitive data, such as encryption keys, between nodes in a 
                   distributed system without detection from an adversary. Typically 
                   timing channels are used by an adversary to exfiltrate data, and 
                   the majority of security research on this topic has pursued their 
                   detection and disruptive capabilities. We show that, when used in 
                   a distributed system with especially high volume of network traffic, 
                   covert timing channels can be an effective means to reestablish 
                   security when a system's network infrastructure has been compromised.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Vinz Clortho is a system independent, TCP Handshake based, Linux 
                   Netfilter kernel module designed to measure inter-node latency, 
                   covertly transmit a message through manipulating packet latency, and 
                   then rebuild that message using Reed-Solomon encoding. Vinz Clortho 
                   can communicate a secret message reliably, albeit slowly, while still 
                   maintaining the ability to remain undetected.
