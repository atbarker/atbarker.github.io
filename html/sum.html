                <p>The challenge of deniability for sensitive data can be a life 
                   or death issue depending on location. Plausible deniability 
                   directly impacts groups such as democracy advocates relaying 
                   information in repressive regimes, journalists covering human 
                   rights stories in a war zone, and NGO workers hiding food 
                   shipment schedules from violent militias. All of whom would 
                   benefit from a plausibly deniable storage system. Previous 
                   deniable storage solutions only offer pieces of an 
                   implementable solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Artifice operates through the use of a virtual block device 
                   driver stored separately from the hidden data. It uses external 
                   entropy sources and erasure codes to deniably and reliably 
                   store data within the unallocated space of an existing file 
                   system. A set of data blocks to be hidden are combined with 
                   entropy blocks through error correcting codes to produce a set 
                   of obfuscated carrier blocks that are indistinguishable from 
                   other pseudorandom blocks on the disk. A subset of these blocks 
                   may then be used to reconstruct the data. Artifice presents a 
                   truly deniable storage solution through its use of external 
                   entropy and error correcting codes, while providing better 
                   reliability than other deniable storage systems.

                   Artifice is implemented as a Linux Device Mapper target and is 
                   distributed as a loadable Linux kernel module. It is intended 
                   to be installed on a bootable Live disk and be used alongside a 
                   distribution such as Tails. It will support NTFS, EXT4, and FAT32 
                   as public file systems. Artifice source code will be released 
		   under GPL upon completion.<br>

		<h4>Lethe</h4>
		<p>
		    Modern day general data privacy regulations state that people can request for
                    data pertaining to them to be deleted without undue delay. Existing storage
                    systems are not equipped to handle secure deletes and tend to leave traces of
                    deleted data for indeterminant periods of time. Current approaches to secure
                    deletion, repeated overwrite and encryption, are also unsatisfactory. Flash
                    media makes the former especially difficult. SSDs typically allocate new
                    blocks for data, providing logical overwrite, but not overwriting physical
                    flash pages. In place overwrites on flash are costly and negatively impact
                    endurance.
                </p>
		<p>
                    Encryption is an alternative to provide secure deletion. Data is securely
                    deleted if the encryption key used to encrypt the data is forgotten. For a
                    file system, this typically entails at least one key per file. This is
                    problematic when block modifications occur as any modification requires a
                    complete re-encryption of the entire file with a new key. To provide a finer
                    granularity, per block encryption keys can be used as well, but quickly turns
                    into a larger key management problem. To address these shortcomings, we
                    propose Lethe, a new system designed to provide efficient key management and
                    secure deletion in file systems, regardless of storage medium, by utilizing
                    keyed hash trees. Using keyed hash trees, Lethe is able to provide secure
  		    deletion at a block-level granularity, only requiring that exactly one key
  		    needs to be remembered and able to be securely forgotten.

                <h4>Vinz Clortho</h4>
                <p>
                   Covert timing channels present a means of securely transferring 
                   sensitive data, such as encryption keys, between nodes in a 
                   distributed system without detection from an adversary. Typically 
                   timing channels are used by an adversary to exfiltrate data, and 
                   the majority of security research on this topic has pursued their 
                   detection and disruptive capabilities. We show that, when used in 
                   a distributed system with especially high volume of network traffic, 
                   covert timing channels can be an effective means to reestablish 
                   security when a system's network infrastructure has been compromised.

                <p>
                   Vinz Clortho is a system independent, TCP Handshake based, Linux 
                   Netfilter kernel module designed to measure inter-node latency, 
                   covertly transmit a message through manipulating packet latency, and 
                   then rebuild that message using Reed-Solomon encoding. Vinz Clortho 
                   can communicate a secret message reliably, albeit slowly, while still 
                   maintaining the ability to remain undetected.
